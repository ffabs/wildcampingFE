It offers a view of the Kleve nature reserve with the so-called Spiekerberg. The Spiekerberg is an impressive witness of the times - it is the former edge of the North Sea (Kleve = cliff). When the heather is in bloom, this mountain is particularly beautiful to look at in the middle of the rather flat landscape. There are hiking trails through the nature reserve. At the overnight place there is mainly one thing: nature. There are no seats, rubbish bins, water or sanitary facilities. The overnight place is in the FFH area, fire is not permitted.",
